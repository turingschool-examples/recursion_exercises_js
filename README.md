## JS Playground for Recursion Lesson Exercises

### Instructions
* Navigate to the recursion_exercises_js directory
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm test` to run the tests in the test file.
* Write your code in the lib/recursion.js file to pass the tests.

To un-skip a test, remove the `.skip` that follows `describe`

To run a single test in isolation, run `mocha --grep <the string you want to use>` and that entire block will run. (ex. `mocha --grep ".countdown"`, `mocha --grep "Additional Practice"`, etc)
